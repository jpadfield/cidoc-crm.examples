# cidoc-crm.examples
Example diagrams showing how the CIDOC CRM (http://www.cidoc-crm.org/) can be used to model information for Heritage Science. These examples are intended to include paths to actual data. The models were initially developed as part of the IPERION-CH (H2020) Research Project (http://www.iperionch.eu/) but are being further developed and re-used within the SSHOC (H2020) Research Project (https://sshopencloud.eu/)
