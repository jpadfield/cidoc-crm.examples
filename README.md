# cidoc-crm.examples
This project has put together a series of examples showing how the [CIDOC CRM](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/) ontology can be used to model information for Heritage Science. These examples include descriptions of actual data, rather than just representing a theoretical process. The models were initially developed as part of the [IPERION-CH (H2020)](http://www.iperionch.eu/) Research Project but are being further developed and re-used within the [SSHOC (H2020)](https://sshopencloud.eu/) Research Project. 

The examples are included here as a series of simple text files listing all of the immediate relationships and connections for each specific model. These examples will not be static and will be updated as a result of collaborative discussion and developments related to the [CIDOC CRM](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/).

In addition to the simple text files a visualisation of the mapping models can be seen via the GitHub pages associated with this repository see: https://jpadfield.github.io/cidoc-crm.examples/ - this presentation will be updated in line with the developments of the raw triples, but there may well be a lag depending on the number of changes and additions made.

# Dependencies
The visualisation web-pages are built using an automated process based on the current set of models. The build process has been written in php and needs to run locally within a cloned version of this repository. In order for the build process to work an additional repository, **d3-process-map** will also need to be cloned from GitHub into the same directory as this one.
