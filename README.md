# cidoc-crm.examples
Example diagrams showing how the CIDOC CRM (http://www.cidoc-crm.org/) can be used to model information for Heritage Science. These examples are intended to include paths to actual data. The models were initially developed as part of the IPERION-CH (H2020) Research Project (http://www.iperionch.eu/) but are being further developed and re-used within the SSHOC (H2020) Research Project (https://sshopencloud.eu/)

A visualisation of the initial release of these models can be seen at (https://rdf.ng-london.org.uk/modelling)

A more integrate presentation of this work is being built in the GitHub pages associated with this repository see: https://jpadfield.github.io/cidoc-crm.examples/ - this presentation is almost working but some additional adjustments are need to get the D3 models working.
